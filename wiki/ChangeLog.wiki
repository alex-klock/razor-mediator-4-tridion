= Version 1.1 =

  * Fix for the DynamicItemFields class.  Wasn't properly handling empty values for certain fields (like ComponentFields and EmbeddedSchemaFields).
  * Fix for "HasValue(string)" method.
  * Updated so that Component and Page gets via package name "Component" and "Page" rather than types.
  * Added KeywordModel for Tridion Keywords (easily get Metadata fields now just like other DynamicItemFields)
  * Fix for adding assemblies to your templates.
